When using **Github** we use the file control system known as **Git** and the first thing a user does is create a **repository**, which is basically a project that contains folders, files, images or data sets. And after reading a readme file in the repository, you then create a **branch**, which allows you to have different versions of a repository at one time. These repositories can also be shared through the process of **cloning** which **fetches** the files that are shared on Github. If you make a new branch you are able to make changes to the branch until you see fit and then you are able to **commit** those changes to the repository where it saves these changes. The user will **push** these changes from the **remote** machine onto Github. Before these changes are accepted in to the main repository, the user must create a **pull** request. After the pull request is accepted, it is done **merged**. However sometimes there conflicts when a pull request is made, Github will notify the user about these conflicts until the code is fixed and this is known as a **merge conflict**. After the errors are fixed, the pull will be completed.*
